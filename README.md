üöó **DRIVEMON AI: IoT-Based Driver Monitoring and Speed Alert System with Object Detection**

## Overview
DRIVEMON AI is a real-time **IoT-based Driver Monitoring System** that integrates GPS-based speed tracking, object detection, and AI-powered alerts to enhance road safety. This project uses **OpenCV** and **YOLOv4-Tiny** to detect objects in front of the vehicle and notify clients when the vehicle exceeds speed thresholds or is at risk of collision.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle speed tracking via GPS
- Object detection using **YOLOv4-Tiny** and **OpenCV**
- Automatic speed threshold alert system
- Proximity-based collision risk detection
- Push notification to client devices using **Pushbullet API**
- Web interface to monitor speed, objects, and alerts

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Socket.IO
- Raspberry Pi
- GPS Neo6M Module
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- Pushbullet API
- YOLOv4-Tiny (Pre-trained model)

## How It Works
1. **Speed Monitoring**: GPS continuously tracks the vehicle's speed.
2. **Object Detection**: The camera module captures frames in real-time.
3. **Object Identification**: The captured frames are processed using YOLOv4-Tiny with OpenCV to detect objects like cars, pedestrians, and obstacles.
4. **Collision Alert**: If an object is detected too close while the speed is above the threshold, a warning is sent to the client.
5. **Client Notification**: Pushbullet API sends notifications to registered devices when:
    - Speed exceeds the threshold
    - Object is detected too close at high speed
6. **Web Dashboard**: Users can monitor speed, location, and object detection results from the web interface.

## Installation

## Usage
1. Connect GPS and Camera modules to Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the `gps.py` file for GPS speed monitoring.
```bash
python gps.py
```
3. Run the `final.py` file to start object detection and notifications.
```bash
python final.py
```
